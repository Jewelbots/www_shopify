<h1>Sample Code for Friendship</h1>
<p>There is a coding sample of how to use Friendship Coding board to do something cool when your Jewelbot sees your red friends. You can change this code to do different things for any and all color friends!

Keep in mind that if you were to have code for two different friend colors AND youâ€™re nearby both friend colors, then it will try to do both actions at the same time. This may cause animations to happen in a pattern or the color of the lights to blend.
</p>
<div class="sample_code">
Animation animation;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once
}

void loop() {
  // This code means "if see red friends, then do rainbow animations"
  if(see_red_friends()){
    animation.rainbows();
  }
}
</div>

<h3>After pasting the code into Arduino...</h3>

<h4>1. Make sure your Jewelbots is plugged in to your computer </h4>
It is suggested that the original USB that came with your Jewelbots be used.

<h4>2. Select the correct Jewelbots Board and Port.</h4>
To select a Jewelbots Board: Go to Tools > Boards and scroll down to select "Solo Coding Mode".
<br> To select the port: Go to Tools > Port. Windows should have "COMXX". Mac should have /dev/usberial-xxxx. (The X's being numbers)

<h4>3. Press the magic button for 2 seconds to put your Jewelobts in Uploading Mode</h4>
Make sure it is 2 full seconds (1 mississippi...).
<br> You should see a fading of purple lights, which represents the Jewelbots entering Uploade Mode.

<h4>4. Press the Upload Button on the Arduino IDE</h4>
It is the arrow button in the top left.

<h4>5. Unplug your Jewelbots to see the results!</h4>
When it says "Done Uploading", you can unplug your Jewelbots to see the code in action.
<br> The act of your Jewelbots running custom code is called "Coding Mode".

<h4> Test out more code combinations</h4>
Try using different colors! (RED, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE, CYAN, YELLOW, MAGENTA)
Try using different animations!

<h4> Share what you code for your Jewelbots </h4>
