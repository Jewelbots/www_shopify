  <h2>Coding your Jewelbots with Friends</h2>
</div>

<p>Coding with friends is even more fun when you have your Jewelbots! With the Jewelbots friendship library you
can supercharge the default functionality of your Jewelbots. Want to make your Jewelbots go to rainbow mode when the whole crew is together?
Do it! Share what you make <a href="http://alpha.jewelbots.com/c/cool-stuff">here.</a></p>

<p>This library keeps the default functionality of your Jewelbots and lets you code around it. It is more limited than the Solo Coding
library as things like a long button press is reserved for friending. </p>
