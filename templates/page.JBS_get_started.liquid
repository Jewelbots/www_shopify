  <h2>First time? Here's how you get started on your coding adventure!</h2>
</div>

<h4>Step One</h4>

<p>Download the Arduino IDE, you can find those <a href="/pages/boards">instructions here.</a></p>

<h4>Step Two</h4>

<p>The Arduino IDE is a programming environment that let's you code for lots of different things. You need
to set it up to work with Jewelbots, so follow the steps to <a href/pages/boards">add the Jewelbots boards.</a> </p>

<h4>Step Three</h4>

<p>Upload a sample sketch to make sure everything is working! You can find <a href="/pages/samples">one here.</a></p>

<h4>Step Four</h4>

<p>Code away! If you have a friend with a Jewelbot head over to <a href="/pages/friendship-library">friendship coding</a>.

If you're alone, coding is still super fun! Just head over to the <a href="/pages/about-library">solo coding</a> section for instructions. </p>

<h4>Step Five</h4>

<p>Share what you build! Head over to our <a href="http://community.jewelbots.com">community site </a>to see what other people have made/show off your coding skills! </p>
