  <h2>Here is how you code the Jewelbots LEDs to animate!</h2>
</div>

<p>The Animation class constructs objects that represent all the LEDs attached
to the physical Jewelbot. There are 4 LEDs total that are connected to the Jewelbot.</p>


<h3>COMPONENT INTIALIZATION</h3>
<div class="sample_code">
Animation animation;
//naming the variable type and then the name of variable.
</div>

<p>In order to use the LED functions, you first need to initialize the library. This tells your program that you want to code
around the LEDs, then you can use the functions below to do cool things with LEDs!</p>

<p>The different functions are called the "API", because they are the way you interact with the device. APIs are ways you can work
with different interfaces, sometimes in a computer and sometimes online. </p>

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
