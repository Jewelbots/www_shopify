<h2>Some things you need to know before coding your device.</h2>

<h4>Programming is case sensitive.</h4>
<p>For instance, the variable type int has to be in all lowercase, otherwise you will get an error.</p>
<p> Also, you must end every line of code with a semicolon. (unless it has parentheses or brackets)
For instance,<p>
<div class="sample_code">
void setup(){
int x = 2; //there's a semicolon to end the line declaring the variable x.
}
</div>
<h4>Variable Names</h4>
<p>Variables can be named whatever you want them to be.</p>
<p>For instance, in all examples in Jewelbot tutorials, the LED object has always been declared as led. However, you can totally declare it as whatever you want! </p>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Programmers will often put comments next to their code to help other users understand what their code does.
All comments start with "//", and are ignored by the compiler, meaning they do not affect your code.</p>


<h4>The Setup() function</h4>
<p>The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, etc. The setup function will only run once, after each power up or reset of the Arduino board.

For example,</p>
<div class="sample_code">
void setup() {
  LED led;
  // declaring an LED variable to be named "led"
}
</div>
<h3>Conditional Statements</h3>

<p>These are logical arithmetic statements you can implement into your program in order to control different functions or loops.</p>

<p>For instance, you can use these conditional statements to turn your Jewelbot into a calculator!
Let's say you have variables called x and y.</p>

<p>You can set these variables to equal your math homework problems!</p>
<div class="sample_code">
void setup(){
  // declare the name of your LED object here.
  LED led;
  // declare the values of your variables x and y
  int x = (4*5+3)^2;
  int y = 20x - (8^2);
}
</div>
<p>
Now you can use the conditional statements to test which variable is bigger!</p>

<h4>If...then...</h4>
<p>This is a conditional statement that performs an activity only if something specific happens.</p>

<div class="sample_code">
if (x > y ) {
  led.turn_on_all(GREEN);
}
if (y < x ){
  led.turn_on_all(BLUE);
}
</div>

<p>This block of code states that if the variable x is greater than y then your Jewelbot will light up purple on LED pin 1.
The second conditional states that if the variable y is greater than x then your Jewelbot will light up red on LED pin 2.</p>

<h4>If...else...</h4>
<p>This is a conditional statement that performs an activity if something specific happens, but in any situation where that specific thing doesn't happen, then it will do something else.</p>

<div class="sample_code">
if (x < y) {
  led.turn_on_all(RED);
}
else {
  led.turn_on_all(WHITE);
}
</div>
<p>
This block of code programs your Jewelbot to turn the LED on pin 1 to light up purple if variable x is greater than y.
Otherwise, your Jewelbot will turn the LED on pin 2 to light up red for all other conditions, without having to set up a conditional for if y is greater than x.
</p>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that continually repeats.</p>
<h4>Loop()</h4>
<p>The loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively whatever you coded your program to do over and over again!</p>
<div class="sample_code">
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  LED led;
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  led.flash_single(SE, BLUE, 65000);
  // it will loop to have one LED be the color blue for 65000 milleseconds
}
</div>

<h4>For loop</h4>
<p>This is different from the if-then or if-else conditionals, as this will set a conditional that causes your program to loop itself a specific amount of times.</p>

<p>The for loop has a set of 3 parameters. A declaration of an int, a condition for running the loop, and an increment.

For instance, a for loop could start as for(int z = 0, z < 10, z++). This means that there is a variable of z with the value of 0, that will increase by 1 for as long as it is less than 10.
However, the value of z will only increment when the for loop completes one cycle of the steps you programmed within it.</p>
<div class="sample_code">
for(int a = 2, a <=20, a++){
  led.flash_single(NW, YELLOW, 1000);
  led.flash_single(NE, MAGENTA, 1000);
}
