			<h4 class="question">How long should I wait before sending another message to another Jewelbot?</h4>

			<h4 class="question">Why is there a delay in messages being sent to my Jewelbot or my friend’s Jewelbot?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				Depending on how far away the Jewelbots are from each other, there might be a delay in receiving messages. If too far away, the message might not even be sent entirely.

		<div class="question_container">
			<h4 class="question">Why isn’t my Jewelbot sending/receiving messages?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				This may be because it is not properly paired with whoever is trying to send you a message.
				<br /><br />
				Your Jewelbot may be too far away from whoever is trying to message you has moved out of range, or lost connection signal. Try turning your Jewelbot on and off.

		<div class="question_container">
			<h4 class="question">Why is my Jewelbot receiving messages when I wasn’t sent one?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				If your Jewelbot was sent a message when a friend was in range to you, but you became out of range or lost signal before the message was sent then you might have received that message when your Jewelbot becomes in range or gains signal again.

		<div class="question_container">
			<h4 class="question">How come my Jewelbot only cycles through one or two colors even though I have more friendship color groups than that?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				When in messaging mode, the Jewelbot will only cycle through friendship color groups nearby you. (i.e. if only red and green friends are nearby, then it will only cycle between red and green for you to choose from).
