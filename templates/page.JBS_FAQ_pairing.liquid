			<h4 class="question">How do I know when my Jewelbot is in pairing mode?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				Your device will flash white on all 4 LEDs if in pairing mode. If another Jewelbot nearby also in pairing mode then wait until they detect each other. <i>One</i> device will start cycling between 4 colors, while the second maintains all LEDs on white.
				<br> If there are no other Jewelbots around to pair with, the Jewelbot will continue to flash white LEDs. Hit the magic button again to turn off pairing mode.

			<h4 class="question">How do I change my friendship color? I don't like the color I paired my friends with.</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				If you want to change the friendship color you chose when you paired the first time, just re-enter pairing mode and pair your Jewelbots again the same way before with a different color.

			<h4 class="question">Help! My Jewelbot wont go into pairing mode!</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				If you've recently coded your device, your code is over-riding the Jewelbot friendship functions. To have friendship functions, put your Jewelbot back to factory firmware settings. You can do this by uploading a blank sketch to your Jewelbot with the "Factory Firmware Update" board back onto your Jewelbots in order to pair and message.

		<div class="question_container">
			<h4 class="question">Why is my Jewelbot not able to pair correctly with another Jewelbot?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				When you press the magic button of your Jewelbots, it should flash white. If your device detects another Jewelbot in
				pairing mode nearby, then only one will rotate between 4 colors. Pick an LED color to match the two Jewelbots by.
				The person with the rotating colors should press the magic button to choose the color. Now when the two Jewelbots are close to each other, they will always light up in that color. When they move apart, it should stop showing that
				color.
				<br /><br />
				If you feel that you have paired them incorrectly, try repeating the <a href="/pages/pairing/"> pairing steps.</a>
				</br></br>
				If you are still having trouble you may want to ensure both devices must have the same firmware earlier or later than 1.0.4 which was published 3/1/17.
			  If you are unsure, update them both.</p>

			<h4 class="question">Can Jewelbots pair more than 2 at a time?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				No. Jewelbots can only pair 2 devices at a time. You can have up to 8 different Jewelbots friends with the same friendship color, but you'd have to pair with each friend individually.
			</div>
		</div><!--//question_container -->
		<div class="question_container">
			<h4 class="question">How far away can Jewelbots be from each other?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				The Jewelbot is able 	to detect a friend within 30 - 50  feet from each other depending on surroundings. However, pairing must be done when the Jewelbots are within 2 feet of each other. Messaging mode requires a strong connection and works best the closer the Jewelbots are to each other.
