			<h4 class="question">How do I know when my Jewelbot is in pairing mode?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				Your device will flash white on all 4 LEDs if in pairing mode. If another device is detected nearby to also be in pairing mode, then both devices will start cycling between 4 colors. If there are no other Jewelbots around to pair with, hit the magic button again to turn off pairing mode.

			<h4 class="question">Help! My Jewelbot wont go into pairing mode!</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				If you've recently coded your device, make sure you put the "Jewelbots Updated Firmware" board back onto your Jewelbots in order to pair and message.

			<h4 class="question">Why is my Jewelbot not able to pair correctly with another Jewelbot?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				When you press the magic button of your Jewelbots, it should flash white. If your device detects another Jewelbot in
				pairing mode nearby, then both will rotate between 4 colors. Pick an LED color to match the two Jewelbots by
				(it's okay if they are not chosen in sync). You press the magic button to choose the color. Now when the
				two Jewelbots are close to each other, they will always blink in that color. When they move apart, it should stop blinking that
				color.
				<br /><br />
				If you feel that you have paired them incorrectly, try repeating the pairing steps.
				</br></br>
				If you are still having trouble you may want to ensure both devices must have the same firmware earlier or later than 1.0.4 which was published 3/1/17.
			  If you are unsure, update them both.</p>

			<h4 class="question">Do I need to have matching friendship colors with the Jewelbot I want to pair with?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				Yes. Friendship features work based around color friend groups.

			<h4 class="question">How far away can Jewelbots be from each other?</h4>
			<div class="answer">
				The Jewelbot is able 	to detect a friend within 30 - 50  feet from each other depending on surroundings. However, pairing must be done when the Jewelbots are within 2 feet of each other. Messaging mode requires a strong connection and works best the closer the Jewelbots are to each other.
