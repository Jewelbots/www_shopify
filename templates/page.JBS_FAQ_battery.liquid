			<div class="answer">
				Some suggestions to solve this would be:
				<ul>
					<li> Press the Magic Button briefly to make sure your Jewelbot is not in Sleep Mode. Your Jewelbot has to be on in order for it to show notification that it is charging.</li>
					<li> Make sure you are using a high quality micro USB; preferably the one we sent with your original package!</li>
					<li> Try connecting your Jewelbot to a high quality power source, such as directly to your computer rather than an external USB hub.</li>
					<li> Try removing other USB accessories from your computer, and only having the Jewelbot plugged in.</li>
				</ul>
